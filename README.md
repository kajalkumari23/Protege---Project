# Protégé 

The Protege web application was developed to address a common issue faced by juniors in college: the lack of opportunities to interact with seniors for guidance related to studies or other aspects. The web application provides a platform for mentees to connect with mentors from different tech domains who can guide them on their tech journey.


## Idea

During our first year in college, we often felt intimidated by our new surroundings, and found ourselves pondering upon questions like "Which programming language to learn?" "Which books to refer?" "How to not miss-out on opportunities?"
Protégé aims to answer all these questions and more by connecting students with their seniors who will mentor them in all aspects of college life. The website allows the students to connect with a mentor, access the resource center and stay updated with upcoming events.
